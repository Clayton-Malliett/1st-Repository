                <h1>Importance of Wolves</h1>
                    <p>Wolves are a keystone species. Keystone species plays a unique and crucial role in the way an ecosystem
                    functions. Without keystone species, the ecosystem, in which they live, would be dramatically different or
                    cease to exist. Yellowstone Park is a good example of this.
                    Wolves
                    prey on injured, sick, old, young and genetically inferior elk, moose, and deer, allowing the healthy
                    individuals to breed and continue their species.
                    Wolves help feed other animals in the ecosystem. Carrion feeders and other scavengers like eagles, bears and
                    crows eat the remains left by wolves. The remains of kills left by wolves often help many species survive
                    hard winters.
                    Wolves help improve riparian areas (the wetland areas adjacent to rivers and streams). Wolves help
                    redistribute ungulate herds which allow vegetation to recover & grow along rivers & streams. In turn, this
                    helps provide more food for beavers. Aquatic animals like frogs and fish & aquatic plants benefit from
                    increased beaver ponds. Additionally, shade created by the trees cools the water, making the habitat better
                    for many aquatic species.</p>
